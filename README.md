# Cellular automata exploration

## Automaton 1 - Purple Chaos (with sound)
Multiple state automaton with extended Moore neighbourhood. Rules were invented on the spot, so nothing fancy comes out from this automaton.

## Automaton 2 - Game of Life
Classical Conway's rules, i.e.
* if cell is dead and has exactly three neighbors then it will be alive in the next generation
* if cell is alive and has less than two or more than three neighbors then it will die
* otherwise cell doesn't change its state
